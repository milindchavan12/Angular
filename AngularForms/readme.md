# Angular Forms
There are 2 Angular Form Technologies:
- Template Driven forms
- Reactive Forms

## Form Validation 
Following are the validation classes by which Angular performs the validation on fields:

- ng-untouched  : The form field not touched/modified.
- ng-touched    : The field is tabed in or modified.
- ng-pristine   : the field is not yet changed since the starting value.
- ng-dirty      : As soon as user, changes the field it becomes, *dirty*
- ng-valid      : the field has valid value
- ng-invalid    : the field has invalid value
